# Refined Project Statement

## Background
We've previously collaborated on both UI/UX design and backend implementation for this mobile app. So far, we've successfully implemented the backend for the "Home" and "Pets" screens by working methodically screen-by-screen.

## Prerequisite Resources
**IMPORTANT:** Before beginning any analysis or implementation work, you must thoroughly review:
- Our previous backend discussions: `C:\Project\petcoapp\session_summaries_backend`
- Our frontend development history: `C:\Project\petcoapp\session_summaries_frontend`

Understanding our previous work and established patterns is essential to maintaining consistency and ensuring proper integration with existing components.

## Current Task
After reviewing the prerequisite resources, we need to focus on the "Services" screen. I've already begun backend implementation for this screen but require your assistance to:
1. Thoroughly analyze the current state of the "Services" screen backend
2. Identify what components are complete and what remains to be implemented
3. Complete all remaining backend functionality to 100% readiness

## Scope Details
The "Services" screen includes multiple components that need careful attention:
- Modal windows
- Cards/content displays
- Filter functionality
- Sub-screens and navigation
- Any other interactive elements

## Deliverables
A fully functional backend implementation for the "Services" screen that properly supports all UI components and user interactions.

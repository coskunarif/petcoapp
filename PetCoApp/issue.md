**Component Hierarchy Issues:**

1. **Disconnected Empty State Component**
   The central "No services available" card exists as an isolated component without clear relationship to surrounding elements. This creates a visual and functional disconnect in the user journey.

2. **Floating Action Elements**
   The "All Services" filter button appears to be floating independently rather than integrated with the content area it affects. This separation makes it unclear how user interactions with this button influence what should appear below.

3. **Partial Visibility Problem**
   There's a partially visible component below the empty state card, creating an ambiguous interface where users can't determine if important content is being obscured or if scrolling is expected.

4. **Component Communication Failure**
   The components don't effectively communicate with each other. The "All Services" selection should logically influence content display, but the empty state provides no contextual reference to this selection.

## Notes for Implementation

1. Tasks should generally be completed in order, as many later tasks depend on earlier functionality.

2. Each task should be tested individually before marking as complete.

3. Update this document as tasks are completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.

4. Add sub-tasks as needed for more detailed tracking.

5. Prioritize core functionality over polish and optimization.

6. Consider implementing key screens in parallel to allow for design consistency checks.

7. Review completed tasks against the design document to ensure alignment with the original vision.

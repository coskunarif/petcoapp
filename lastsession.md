  ## 1. Primary Request and Intent

  The user's primary intent has been to implement features for the PetCoApp according to a structured implementation roadmap. They have asked me to:

  1. Complete tasks in a specific order as defined in the implementation-tasks.md file
  2. Mark completed tasks in the implementation-tasks.md document
  3. Implement features with high-quality code, error handling, and user experience
  4. Focus on one section at a time, completing all tasks within a section before moving to the next
  5. Track progress using a todo list

  Most recently, the user specifically asked:
  > "please mark @implementation-tasks.md document and start next task"

  After completing the Payment Integration section, I've been implementing the Transaction Processing section, which includes handling payments, fees, transactions,
  receipts, errors, and refunds.

  ## 5. Pending Tasks

  From the Financial Reporting section, we have these pending tasks:

  1. Build transaction history (in progress)
  2. Implement earnings reports for providers
  3. Create spending reports for owners
  4. Add export functionality
  5. Implement tax summaries

  ## 6. Current Work

  We've just completed the Transaction Processing section and started work on the Financial Reporting section. The first task is "Build transaction history," which
  we've marked as in progress.

  We were attempting to create an enhanced version of the TransactionHistoryScreen with the following features:
  1. Advanced filtering (date range, category, payment method, status)
  2. Grouping by time periods (month, week, day)
  3. Charts for transaction trends
  4. Summary statistics
  5. Transaction categories with visual indicators
  6. Export functionality
  7. Pagination for large data sets

  However, we encountered some issues when trying to implement this screen, and the task was interrupted.

  Our most recent attempt was to create a new or enhanced version of the TransactionHistoryScreen.tsx file with comprehensive features for transaction history
  visualization and management.

  ## 7. Optional Next Step

  The next logical step is to continue implementing the enhanced TransactionHistoryScreen, as it's the current in-progress task from our todo list:

  ```json
  [{"content":"Build transaction history","status":"in_progress","priority":"high","id":"41"},{"content":"Implement earnings reports for
  providers","status":"pending","priority":"high","id":"42"},{"content":"Create spending reports for
  owners","status":"pending","priority":"medium","id":"43"},{"content":"Add export
  functionality","status":"pending","priority":"medium","id":"44"},{"content":"Implement tax summaries","status":"pending","priority":"high","id":"45"}]
  ```

  The user explicitly asked to "mark @implementation-tasks.md document and start next task" and we were in the middle of creating the TransactionHistoryScreen with
  advanced features:

  ```
  Create a new enhanced version of the transaction history screen. Create the file frontend/src/screens/profile/TransactionHistoryScreen.tsx with the following
  features:
  1. A list of transactions with detailed information
  2. Advanced filtering (date range, category, payment method, status)
  3. Grouping by month, week, or day with collapsible sections
  4. Charts for transaction trends (using react-native-chart-kit)
  5. Summary statistics (totals, averages)
  6. Transaction categories with icons
  7. Export functionality (PDF, CSV)
  8. Pagination for large transaction sets
  9. Multi-select for bulk operations
  10. Advanced search with filters
  11. Use transactionService for data fetching
  ```

  Therefore, we should continue creating this screen to fulfill the "Build transaction history" task that we've already marked as in progress.
